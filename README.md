interactive tables, and plotting tools** needed to complete population
management lab modules using R. It also supports `learnr` tutorials and
Shiny-based apps for interactive learning.

## Features

- **Pedigree visualization** with `pedtools` and `visNetwork`
- **Population viability metrics** including lambda, life tables, and
  kinship
- **Interactive demographic tables** using `reactable`
- **Standardized color palettes** for sex, status, and location
- ðŸ“¦ Supports `learnr` modules, R Markdown labs, and Shiny apps

## ðŸš€ Installation
