`zoopop` is a custom package for the **Rich Lab for Molecular Health at
the University of Nebraska Omaha**, designed and maintained by
Dr.Â Alicia Rich.

This package includes many of the **functions, datasets, color palettes,
interactive tables, and plotting tools** used most often in our lab
workflows involving published AZA studbook data. Its sister-package,
`zoolabs` contains many of the same tools designed more specifically for
use in teaching exercises from Dr.Â Richâ€™s Zoo Biology course at UNO. The
biggest difference between the two packages is that this one also
contains the necessary functions for importing, cleaning, and
standardizing studbook data, starting from the published pdf files that
we convert into messy csv tables using Adobe Acrobatâ€™s pdf-excel
conversion tool.

## Features

- **Pedigree visualization** with `pedtools` and `visNetwork`
- **Population viability metrics** including lambda, life tables, and
  kinship
- **Interactive demographic tables** using `reactable`
- **Standardized color palettes** for sex, status, and location
- ðŸ“¦ Supports `learnr` modules, R Markdown labs, and Shiny apps

## ðŸš€ Installation

```

### After installing for first use

Load the package each time you want to use a lab tutorial in your
session by copying and pasting the following into your console:

``` r
library(zoopop)
```
