## Introduction

### Goal

This tutorial will walk through example data summary and visualization tools using the `zoopop` package.

### Details

I am going to use the Pygmy Slow Loris population reports to generate a reproducible report that summarizes:

1.  Population Size and Composition

2.  Historic Demographic Trends Compared Across Generations

2.  Contemporary Patterns of Genetic Diversity and Relatedness

3.  Projected Population Viability

### Files Needed

I am loading two csv files created with the `zoopop` package: 

1.  A studbook organized into rows containing static profiles of individuals across the entire population history and individual transfer and breeding events over each individual's lifetime: `studbook.csv`

2.  A table where every institution appearing in the studbook is represented by a single row: `locations.csv`

For more information, see the tutorial below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
learnr::run_tutorial("new_studbook", package = "zoopop")
```



## Setup

```{r setup}

library(conflicted)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(learnr)

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(zoopop)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  message  = FALSE,
  warning  = FALSE,
  echo     = TRUE,
  include  = TRUE,
  eval     = TRUE,
  comment  = ""
)
conflicts_prefer(lubridate::interval)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)


loc_key  <- read_csv(here("inst/extdata/locations.csv"))
studbook <- read_csv(here("inst/extdata/studbook.csv"))
