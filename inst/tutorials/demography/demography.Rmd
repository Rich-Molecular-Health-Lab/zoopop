## Introduction

### Goal

This tutorial will walk through example data summary and visualization tools using the `zoopop` package.

### Details

I am going to use the Pygmy Slow Loris population reports to generate a reproducible report that summarizes:

1.  Population Size and Composition

2.  Historic Demographic Trends Compared Across Generations

  - We will examine these trends at two temporal scales:
  
    a.  Survival, mortality, and reproductive variables over the entire lifetime.
    b.  Age-specific patterns in survival, mortality, and reproduction across the lifetime.
    
3.  Demographic Projections

### Files Needed

I am loading one `csv` file created with the `zoopop` package, which is derived from the published studbook for my population of interest.

>To create a formatted studbook file that will work with the other `zoopop` functions, see the `new_studbook` tutorial. I followed the steps in that tutorial to create `studbook.csv`, which we will read in as a tibble in the setup chunk below.

## Setup

```{r setup, context="setup"}
library(conflicted)
library(knitr)
library(learnr)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
library(zoopop)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  message  = FALSE,
  warning  = FALSE,
  echo     = TRUE,
  include  = TRUE,
  eval     = TRUE,
  comment  = ""
)
studbook <- read_csv("../../extdata/studbook.csv")
```


# Studbook Overview

Let's take a quick glance at our studbook data loaded in the setup chunk.

```{r studbook-view, exercise=TRUE}
print(studbook)
```

## Summarize Demographic Trends

Let's look at the basic population size over time to begin quantifying growth rate and assessing overall population viability.

```{r census, exercise=TRUE}
population.plot <- plot_census(studbook)
population.plot
```

## Demographic Summary

Now we will use annual birth counts to follow the standard method for computing a normalized rate of growth over the past 5 years compared to all years (\u03BB), along with a series of other common life history variables.

>**Note:** You can play around with the values for the `cohort_params` list in this chunk to change the cohort bins and the overall scale of your analysis.
>>**Values available in this list:** `Year_min` (the earliest year to include for analysis), `Year_max` (the latest year to include), `span` (the interval in years to use for lumping individuals into generational cohorts, based on their birth year), `age_max` (the maximum age in years to include when forming cohort bins)
>>**Default values** - if you leave any/all values blank, the following defaults will be used: `Year_min =` *minimum birth year found in studbook*, `Year_min =` *current year*, `span = 10` (*individuals lumped into cohorts based on the decade of their birth*), `age_max =` *maximum age in years observed in studbook records*.

```{r cohort_demog, exercise = TRUE}
demog <- cohort_demog(studbook, cohort_params = list(span = 5))
print(demog)
```

### Summary Table

```{r demog_summary, exercise = TRUE}
demog_summary <- rct_demog(studbook, cohort_params = list(span = 5))
demog_summary
```


### Lifetime Stats

Some of the stats in this table are broken down by age (dynamic values), while others are averaged across each cohort's lifetime (static values). Let's first summarize the static values that are averaged across the lifetime and compared between birth year cohorts.

#### \u03BB

**\u03BB** is the finite rate of increase calculated as \u03BB = `R0^(1/T)`, representing the population growth rate.

```{r lambda, exercise = TRUE}
lambda_plot  <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "lambda")
lambda_plot
```


#### r

***r*** is the intrinsic rate of increase: the **continuous growth rate of the population**, computed as r = log(\u03BB), where \u03BB is the finite rate of increase.

```{r r_plot, exercise = TRUE}
r_plot <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "r")
r_plot
```

#### N1

***N1*** is the total number of individuals at age 1 (i.e. total surviving first year).

```{r N1_plot, exercise = TRUE}
N1_plot <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "N1")
N1_plot
```

#### R0

***R0*** is the **net reproductive rate**, the sum of reproductive outputs (*Fx*) across all ages for the cohort.

```{r R0_plot, exercise = TRUE}
R0_plot <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "R0")
R0_plot
```


#### MLE

***MLE*** - **Maximum Likelihood Estimate** of the **age at 50% survivorship**; the interpolated age where survival drops to 50%.

```{r MLE_plot, exercise = TRUE}
MLE_plot <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "MLE")
MLE_plot
```


#### T

***T*** - *Mean generation time* **(average age of reproduction)**, computed as `T = Tnum/R0` where `Tnum` is the age‐weighted reproductive output.

```{r T_plot, exercise = TRUE}
T_plot <- plot_demog(studbook, list(span = 5), "T")
T_plot
```

#### Array Plots

Now we can also put each of the most informative plots into a single graphic as subplots for ease of comparison.

```{r lifetime_plots, exercise = TRUE}
lifetime_plots <- subplot(
  r_plot,
  style(R0_plot , showlegend = FALSE),
  style(MLE_plot, showlegend = FALSE),
  style(T_plot  , showlegend = FALSE),
  nrows  = 2,
  shareX = TRUE,
  titleY = TRUE
)
lifetime_plots
```


### Age-Specific Variables

#### Lx1

***Lx1*** is the proportion of individuals surviving past the initial age interval (relative to *N1*), used to assess survival beyond infancy.

```{r Lx1_plot, exercise = TRUE}
Lx1_plot <- demog_age_bysex(studbook, list(span = 5), "Lx1")
Lx1_plot
```


#### Qx

***Qx*** is age-specific mortality rate, calculated as the number of deaths in the age interval divided by the risk population (in this case, *Nx*).

```{r Qx_plot, exercise = TRUE}
Qx_plot <- demog_age_bysex(studbook, list(span = 5), "Qx")
Qx_plot
```


#### ex

***ex*** is the life expectancy at age x: the average number of additional years an individual is expected to live if they survive to age x. Calculated as `ex = Tx/Lx`.

```{r ex_plot, exercise = TRUE}
ex_plot <- demog_age_bysex(studbook, list(span = 5), "ex")
ex_plot
```


#### Fx

***Fx*** is the age-specific reproductive output, computed as *Mx* multiplied by *Lx.* It represents the expected number of offspring produced by an individual at age x.

```{r Fx_plot, exercise = TRUE}
Fx_plot <- demog_age_bysex(studbook, list(span = 5), "Fx")
Fx_plot
```
